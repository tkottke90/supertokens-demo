# Demo: SuperTokens

I learned recently about [SuperTokens](https://supertokens.com) as an alternative to Firebase Auth, Auth0, and Keycloak.  The market themselves as a developer friendly solution to authentication as a service. 

For this project I followed their [Email/Password and Social Tutorial](https://supertokens.com/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/introduction) (using my own UI) to learn about how to implement this in an existing project.  

Overall it seems to live up to it's selling points and was fairly straight forward to implement.  I think I will be using it in the future as an alternative to Keycloak which I have found to be a struggle to implement.
